# Web Scrapping Mini Project


## Context
I was recently hired as a  data analyst by Formula 1 to conduct a driver and team standings analysis. The company is currently receiving complaints from fans and losing audience due to the past complete domination from from team Mercedes AMG and driver lewis Hamilton. The F1 company wants me to dicover any possible insights into team and driver results compared to the regulations in the past years. 


## TODO's
- Official Formula 1 web to scrape.
- Driver and team standings is the appropiate chosen information.
- Clean the data.
- Visualize at least 5 insights and export the graphs.


## Deliverables
1) Jupyter notebook with the scraped data.
2) Exported cleaned data and visualization data.
3) Create a markdown file (like the readme) with a brief report including at least 5 graphs summarizing conclusions. Using markdown format and including the exported graphs as images.
